# High Card Game

## About the game

This game generates an equal amount of cards and for each card you who ever has a higher card will get a point. If the cards are the same, no one will get a point and if the total points are equal then the match is a draw.

For example:

* Player Hand: 2 5 A -> Score: 0+0+1=1
* Computer Hand: 2 6 K -> Score: 0+1+0=1
